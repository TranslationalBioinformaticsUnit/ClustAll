# 0. Introduction

ClustAll is an R package originally designed for patient stratification
in complex diseases.

The ClustAll framework is dedicated for identifying patient subgroups,
addressing common challenges encountered in clinical data analysis. The
underlying concept is that a robust stratification should be
reproducible through various clustering methods. To achieve patient
stratification, ClustAll employs diverse distance metrics
(Correlation-based distance and Gower distance) and clustering methods
(K-Means, K-Medoids, and H-Clust).

Moreover, ClustAll:

-   **Handles Diverse Data Types:** Enables the analysis of data with
    missing values, mixed data, and correlated variables.

-   **Provides Multiple Stratification Solutions:** Unlike other
    packages, ClustAll doesn not limit results to a single
    stratification solution.

-   **Population-Based Robustness:** Performs a population-based
    robustness analysis for each candidate stratification using
    bootstrapping, ensuring the exclusion of non-robust stratifications.

-   **Parameter-Based Robustness:** Selects representative
    stratifications that demonstrate robustness across variations in
    depth, distance metrics, or clustering methods.

Additionally, the package includes functions to:

-   **Validate Output:** Allows validation using true labels when
    available.

-   **Visualize Patient Flow:** Offers a Sankey diagram to illustrate
    patient flow between clusters when comparing two candidate
    stratifications.

# 1. Installation

ClustAll is developed using S4 object-oriented programming, and requires
R (\>=4.2.0). ClustAll utilizes many other R packages that are currently
available from CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub.

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TranslationalBioinformaticsUnit/ClustAll")
```

After installation, you should be able to load the ClustAll package in
your R session:

```{r load}
library(ClustAll)
```

# 2. ClustAll workflow

ClustAll constitutes a friendly workflow that comprises 8 functions:

#### `createClustAll`

The `createClustAll` function is a key component of the ClustAll
workflow. It serves the purpose of creating an S4 object of class
`ClustAllObject`. This object is specifically designed to facilitate the
application of the ClustAll algorithm and to store the primary results
of the clustering process.

**Usage:**

```         
createClustAll(data_use, nImputation, dataImputed)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `data_use`: A dataframe containing the original dataset. This
    dataset may include missing values (NAs).

-   `nImputation`: A numeric value indicating the number of imputations
    to be computed if the original dataset contains NAs.

-   `dataImputed`: A mids object created with the mice R package. It
    should represent the imputed data used for clustering, and the
    `data_use` and `dataImputed` datasets must originate from the same
    source and include the same variables.\

The ClustAll pipeline is versatile, accommodating three possible
scenarios based on the nature of the input data.

1.  **No Missing Values:** In scenarios where the initial dataset **does
    not contain any missing values (NAs)**, the use of `nImputation` and
    `dataImputed` is not required.
2.  **Missing Values Imputed Within ClustAll Framework:** When the
    initial dataset **contains missing values (NAs)**, the ClustAll
    pipeline offers an integrated solution for imputation using the
    `mice` package. In this case:
    -   `nImputations` is a required parameter to specify the number of
        imputations to be computed within the ClustAll framework.
    -   `dataImputed` is not required, as the imputations are handled
        internally.
3.  **External Imputation with Imputed Data (`mids` class):** If the
    initial dataset **contains missing values (NAs)**, but the
    imputations have been conducted externally (resulting in an imputed
    dataset of class `mids`), the following parameters are needed:
    -   `nImputations` is not required.
    -   `dataImputed` is necessary to provide the imputed dataset, and
        it should be of the `mids` class.

These scenarios offer flexibility in adapting the ClustAll pipeline to
various data conditions, providing users with options depending on their
data preprocessing needs.

#### `runClustAll`

The `runClustAll` method is a pivotal function in the ClustAll pipeline,
responsible for executing the ClustAll algorithm and producing
clustering results.

**Usage:**

```         
runClustAll(Object, threads, simplify)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object, created using the
    `createClustAll` function.

-   `threads`: A numeric value specifying the number of cores to use for
    parallel computing. This parameter enables users to accelerate the
    computation process.

-   `simplify`: A logical value. If set to `TRUE`, only one out of the
    four depths of the dendrogram is considered, streamlining the
    results for simplicity. If set to `FALSE`, all possible depths of
    the dendrogram are considered, offering a more detailed clustering
    analysis.

This method is crucial for running the ClustAll algorithm efficiently,
and the parameters allow users to customize the computational aspects of
the process based on their preferences and system capabilities.

#### `plotJACCARD`

The `plotJACCARD` function is designed to generate a correlation matrix
heatmap that visually represents the Jaccard Distance between
population-robust stratifications stored within a ClustAllObject-class
object.

**Usage:**

```         
plotJACCARD(Object, paint, stratification_similarity)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object created using the
    createClustAll function, containing the results of the ClustAll
    algorithm.

-   `paint`: A logical value. When set to `TRUE`, groups of similar
    stratifications are highlighted within a red square, enhancing the
    visualization of stratification patterns.

-   `stratification_similarity`: A numeric value representing the
    minimum Jaccard Distance required to consider a pair of
    stratifications as similar. The default value is set to 0.7, but
    users can adjust this threshold based on their specific needs.

This function is valuable for gaining insights into the relationships
between different stratifications and understanding the robustness of
population clustering within the context of the ClustAll analysis.

#### `resStratification`

The `resStratification` function is designed to retrieve stratification
representatives by filtering out those that do not contain clusters
representing a minimum percentage of the total population. This function
offers flexibility, allowing users to obtain either all robust
stratifications or a single representative from each group of similar
stratifications.

**Usage:**

```         
resStratification(Object, population, stratification_similarity, all)
```

**Arguments**:

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object created using the
    createClustAll function, containing the results of the ClustAll
    algorithm.
-   `population`: A numeric value indicating the minimum percentage of
    the total population that a cluster in a stratification must have to
    be considered as representative. The default is set to 0.05 (5%).
-   `stratification_similarity`: A numerical value representing the
    minimum Jaccard Distance required to consider a pair of
    stratifications as similar. The default is set to 0.7.
-   `all`: A logical value. When set to `TRUE`, the function returns all
    similar representative stratifications. If set to `FALSE`, only the
    centroid stratification for each group of similar stratifications is
    returned.

This function is useful for extracting meaningful representations of
robust stratifications, enabling users to focus on key clusters within
the population and streamline the interpretation of the clustering
results.

#### `plotSANKEY`

The `plotSankey` function is designed to generate a Sankey diagram
comparing two selected clusters within the ClustAllObject-class object.
This visualization aids in the comparison of stratifications, providing
insights into the flow and distribution of elements between the chosen
clusters.

**Usage:**

```         
plotSankey(Object, clusters)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object created using the
    `createClustAll` function, containing the results of the ClustAll
    algorithm.

-   `clusters`: A character vector with the names of a pair of
    stratifications. The names can be obtained using the
    `resStratification` function.

This function is particularly valuable for visually assessing the
differences and similarities between two selected clusters, allowing for
a more intuitive understanding of the population distribution within the
context of the ClustAll analysis.

#### `cluster2data`

The `cluster2data` function is designed to retrieve a dataframe that
combines the original dataset with the selected ClustAll
stratification(s), which are included as additional variables. This
allows users to explore and analyze the original data in the context of
the identified clusters.

**Usage:**

```         
cluster2data(Object, clusterName)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object created using the
    `createClustAll` function, containing the results of the ClustAll
    algorithm.

-   `clusterName`: A character vector with one or more stratification
    names. These names are used to select the specific ClustAll
    stratifications that will be included as variables in the resulting
    dataframe.

This function is allows the integration of the clustering information
back into the original dataset, facilitating further analysis and
interpretation of the data within the context of the identified
clusters.

#### `Validation`

The `Validation` function is designed to validate the results obtained
from one or more (multiple) robust stratifications by comparing them
with the original data labels, provided the original data labeling is
available.

**Usage:**

``` r
Validation(Object)
```

**Arguments:**

-   `Object`: A ClustAllObject-class object created using the
    `createClustAll` function, containing the results of the ClustAll
    algorithm. This function serves the step for assessing the
    reliability of the obtained robust stratifications. By comparing
    them with the original data labels (if available), it provides a
    validation mechanism to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the
    clustering results in relation to the true underlying patterns in
    the data.

Note: Ensure that the original data labeling is present in the
ClustAllObject for this step.

# 3. Real data scenario:

## Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

This package contains a real dataset of breast cancer ([doi:
10.24432/C5DW2B](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5DW2B)). The dataset
comprises two types of features ---categorical and numerical--- derived
from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass
from 659 patients. Each patient is characterized by 30 features (10x3)
and belongs to one of two target classes: 'malignant' or 'benign'.

To showcase ClustAll's when dealing with missing data, a modification
with random missing values was applied to the dataset, demonstrating the
package's resilience in handling missing data. The breast cancer dataset
includes the following features:

a)  **radius:** Mean of distances from the center to points on the
    perimeter.
b)  **texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
c)  **perimeter**
d)  **area**
e)  **smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths.
f)  **compactness:** (Perimeter\^2 / Area) - 1.0.
g)  **concavity:** Severity of concave portions of the contour.
h)  **concave points:** Number of concave portions of the contour.
i)  **symmetry**
j)  **fractal dimension:** "Coastline approximation" - 1.

The dataset also includes the patient ID and diagnosis (M = malignant, B
= benign).
